#### Note

- This is the first assignment for this course, you should read the [guidelines](https://github.com/xuyige/PRML-Spring20-FDU/blob/master/README.md) and consent to the agreement before doing it.

- The deadline of this assignment is **<span style="color: red">May 6, 2020</span>** (for 3 weeks), before the course start.

- For instructions of submission, please also see the [guidelines](https://github.com/xuyige/PRML-Spring20-FDU/blob/master/README.md).


#### Description

In this assignment, you are required to design a RNN-based neural network to simulate an adder.

##### Part I

In this part, you are required to learn how to write your source code based on Tensorflow 2.0 (TF) or PyTorch (PT). Source code based on TF or PT is available in directory [`example`](https://github.com/xuyige/PRML-Spring20-FDU/blob/master/assignment-2/example) . You are required to clone one of them to your own directory and finish the rest of codes. (If you find any mistakes from the example source code, please contact TA [@xuyige](https://github.com/xuyige).)

##### Part II

In this part, you are required to modify the length of digits. You need to analyze the performance of your model and then improve your model.

#### Requirements

- A report named `report.pdf` is required. In your report, you should include the description for your models, the analysis for your models, and the command lines for running your source code.

- A plain python source code named `source.py` is required. Other python source code should be organized in the directory `handout`.

- Notice that the source code should be as clean as possible.

- For TF, you should use tensorflow 2.0+. For PT, you should use torch 1.0+.

- Instructions for installing [TF](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PT](https://pytorch.org/).
